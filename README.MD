## Functional Interfaces Don't Stop
This library is intended to provide utility functional interfaces similar to the ones in <code>java.util.function</code>.
It also contains a few classes that are just utility but not really *functional interfaces*
At present it contains the following :
* TriFunction
* TriConsumer
* Triplet
* QuadriFunction
* QuadriConsumer
* Pair
## Building
Build it like any other gradle project, if you have gradle:
```
$ gradle build
```
Or, if you do not have Gradle
```
$ ./gradlew build
```
